### Hi there.
This blog is a place for me to document, list reminders, and rant about my current life as a grad student in Japan.  

I write in a very opinionated way, fully aware that when I make generalizations, these are merely generalizations and opinions. I will generally forego 'political correctness' for the sake of clarity, brevity and strength. If you are touchy, you might not like this blog :).  

Feel free to get in touch with me, in case you want to ask questions, make comments or even visit my [lab](http://www.cmplx.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/) here in Sendai (or whatever else). You can find me most easily at heim.steve\_at-symbol\_gmail com.
