### Hi there.
This blog is a place for me to document, list reminders, and rant about my current life as a grad student in Japan. My initial commitment to start this blog is to document the painfully obscure and frustrating process of getting a scholarship to study here, but I won't limit myself to the purely academic.  

Hopefully some of my ruminations may be insightful and perchance even helpful to others.

Feel free to get in touch with me, in case you want to ask questions, make comments or even visit my [lab](http://www.cmplx.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/) here in Sendai (or whatever else). You can find me most easily at heim.steve\_at-symbol\_gmail com.
