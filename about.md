### Hi there.
This blog is a largely inactive place for me to document, list reminders, and rant about my current life as a grad student <del>in Japan</del> in Germany (and frankly, in general). In broad terms, I'm interested in how nature solves optimality problems, and how complex behavior emerges out of the interaction of simple rules, especially in the context of dynamics. I'm currently pursuing a phd understanding the influence of morphology on how easy it is to learn control in legged robots and animals.  

I reserve the right to write in a very opinionated way. I will generally forego 'political correctness' for the sake of clarity, brevity and strength. If you are touchy, you might not like this blog :).  

Feel free to get in touch with me, in case you want to ask questions, make comments or visit my [lab](https://dlg.is.mpg.de/) here in Stuttgart. You can find me most easily at heim.steve\_at-symbol\_gmail com.
